## Details
**Project Title:** Finding the Optimal reorder quantities of fresh produce products

**Description:** ValueGreens SG is a fresh fruits and vegetable retailer which takes pride in providing fresh quality produce through careful handpicking of vegetables every morning. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in ValueGreens adding an online groceries shopping platform to complement their physical stores. Due to the perishable nature of fruits and vegetables, ValueGreens restocks its inventory daily to ensure freshness and disposes of groceries deemed “unfresh”. Our team was tasked with identifying which products were their more popular products and determining an optimal ordering strategy to minimize wastage and maximize profits.
